# IoT Scenario

###### Windfarm
Peter Wind wants to expand his portfolio of wind farms. His problem is that after some time he recognzed that his current wind farms weren't optimzed considering location. Peter has the problem that some of his wind farms aren't generating the energy he wanted due to evironmental problems and low wind speed. Peter doesn't wanted to make this problem again. Therefore Peter uses his distributed environmental managment system. With this system, Peter is able to monitor to environmental conditions of every station. When Peter goes to the bank to get a credit, he just pulls out his smartphone to present the data that was calculated over time and shows it to them. Peter can show the income of the next 5 years according to production of the best locations. The bank says to Peter what he can expect as a credit. Peter shows them the 10 wind farms he can build with this budget, calculated by the system via the best position and the calculation of the different constructions sites. The bank is impressed from the income of this 10 wind farms and grants him even more budget. Peter than again calculates 20 wind farms with the system and has the perfect location for every wind farm.
