# Scaling and Tasting

### What will be issues scaling (system size, number of systems, management) ?

* Finding faulty devices
  * Heartbeat
  * Central monitor
* Testing: Simulators in specific
* Configuration management -> what do you want to manage, how do you keep specific configurations
* Just scale up scenarios and find problems there
* Can you update them all at once?
* Simulators allow the simulation of a multitude of devices
* Consistency in communication between devices
* Security threat

### How can we do testing?

* Device testing before use
* Simulators with Test cases

### What role will play
* Simulator(-component)s?
  * Check how the system reacts to multiple devices
* MQTT
  * Validating of the communication
* Stories
  * Helps to construct IoT systems
  * Define use case and application purpose so the implementation is flawless
