##### Data protocols

* MQTT
  * Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) is a protocol that was specifically created for SCADA systems and their related networks. It uses a publish/subscribe mechanism to minimize the payload and overhead with application-specific, custom JSON or binary formats. MQTT is widely accepted in IT departments worldwide, with many open source examples available in just about any programming language. We recommends using MQTT when network bandwidth is at a premium, and always with a secure communication method such as TLS.


* Modbus 
  * Modbus is an open serial communication protocol that has become a standard communications protocol in industry, and is now the most commonly available means of connecting industrial electronic devices. It is used widely by many manufacturers throughout many industries. Versions of the Modbus protocol exist for serial lines (Modbus RTU and Modbus ASCII) and for Ethernet (Modbus TCP). 

##### Devices

* Lightbulb which can be switched on/off via smartphone
* Heartmonitor implant of a person which communicates
* GPS Tracker for animals/trucks/trains/….
