# Project 1 - Scenario

Gertrud lives alone and has had an accident where she injured her knee. Although she has pain walking outside, she is a avid gardener and is known for her tomatoes. Because of her knee she isn't able to walk outside all the time to watch them. With the help of the TomatoWatcher3000 from Jakob&Valentin she can have her tomatoes without risking to much pain. The TamatoWatcher3000 uses a temperatur and a humidity sensor to watch the status of the tomatoes environment.

###### Scenario

Gertrud wakes up at 8:00 and walks to her kitchen where the TomatoWatcher3000 base station is located. She presses the button and immediately gets the signal that everything is ok. Because it was raining during the night and it's not to hot outside the warning LED of the systems signals 'green' and Gertrud can read the message displayed via the Display, which says that the humidity status is 'Moist' and the temperature is 18.95°C.

After dinner Gertrud wants to know the status of her tomatoes, thus she presses the button again. The display shows 'DRY' and 29.95°C and the warning LED signals 'red'. Gertrude goes outside and waters them and after an hour she presses the button again to see the warning LED signals 'green' and the display showing 'MOIST' and 27.95°C.

Before she goes to sleep she presses the button again, but everything is ok so she can go to sleep without worrying about the tomatoes.
