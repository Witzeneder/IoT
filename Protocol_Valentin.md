## 15 November 2018
First day of lecture

###### Lecture

The lecture started of with a basic overview of IoT and we discussed our personal experience surrounding IoT. I immediately got the feeling that this lecture won't be like the lecture we had before during the bachelor program. But I really liked the style and the self learning part, which leads to a better understanding in the end. At the end of the lecture I was surprised of the immense number of use cases in IoT.

The first lab started of rather easy, because I've already had some experience with a raspberry pi system and the instructions of the first part where very clearly and so it was easy to finish it.
Using the Arduino Board and completing the second part of the lab was rather complicated because some of the boards we had were not working properly. But in the end we found one which was able to run the code we made. We also had some board parts which we will put together in the next labs.

Second day of lecture

The first part of the lecture was hard to follow and the exercises to it where rather complicated, because of the high numbers of different buses/interfaces used and to get the basic concept and differences between them - I had to do some digging after the lecture by myself.

The second part of the lecture was easy and interesting to follow. With the help of the scenarios I got a better understanding of IoT in general and it was quite fun to come up with one scenario on our own.

The first exercise of the lab was difficult to finish and at first I was frustrated that the webhook wasn't functioning like I intended. After some talking with colleagues we found out that the problem was to use 'HTTP' instead of 'HTTPS' which solved my problem rather quickly. Also the board had some problems because it would flash correct. After trying some time I used another board which we put together just some minutes before and then it worked like it should. The second part of the lab [I2C display] was quite easy because I got some help of another group [Julia Hauptmann and Nikolaus Hofer] which showed me the correct cable connection. For the temperature exercise Jakob found a great tutorial which helped us to finish it.

Exercises where really time intensive - more time would've been good.
