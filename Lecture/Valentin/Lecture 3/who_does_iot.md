## IETF
Internet Engineering Task Force

###### Goal
The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is an open standards organization, which develops and promotes voluntary Internet standards, in particular the standards that comprise the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP). It has no formal membership or membership requirements. All participants and managers are volunteers, though their work is usually funded by their own employers or own sponsors.

* works on a broad range of networking technologies which provide foundation for the Internet's growth and evolution
* organized into a large number of working groups and informal discussion groups (BoFs, or Birds of a Feather), each dealing with a specific topic
* started out as an activity supported by the U.S. federal government
* Three times a year the IETF Meeting takes place (location is based on where the most members are located)

###### Members
A Nominating Committee (NomCom) of ten randomly chosen volunteers who participate regularly at meetings is vested with the power to appoint, reappoint, and remove members of the IESG, IAB, IASA, and the IAOC. To date, no one has been removed by a NomCom, although several people have resigned their positions, requiring replacements.
