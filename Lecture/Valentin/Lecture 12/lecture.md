IoT Maintenance

###### What is predictive maintenance?
Process to determine the condition of in-service equipment in order to predict when maintenance should be performed.

###### What problem(s) does it solve?
Cost savings over routine or time-based preventive maintenance, because tasks are performed only when warranted

###### How is it related to IoT?
An IoT-based solution allows storing terabytes of data and running machine learning algorithms on several computers in parallel to forecast potential hazards and pinpoint when industrial equipment is likely to fail.

###### Give 3 examples of predictive maintenance in the IoT.

* Oil & Gas
  * Physical inspection of oil & gas production equipment requires personnel to go into hazardous environment to examine the equipment, which in some cases is not feasible. IoT-based predictive maintenance allows oil & gas companies to identify potential failures and increase the production of highly critical assets.


* Railways
  * Railway companies apply IoT-based predictive maintenance to ensure the rails and the rolling stock are in proper condition. Force detectors, vision cameras, infrared and acoustic sensors to identify defects in freight-car braking capabilities, excessive friction in wheels and bearings, rail curves and straightaways damages. Data gathered by sensors is relayed to the cloud for analysis and run through ML algorithms to reveal unhealthy data patterns that lead to breakages.


* Construction
  * In construction, predictive maintenance is applied to monitor the state of heavy machinery, e.g. excavators, bulldozers, loaders, lifts, etc. Sensors can be attached to a machine to monitor transmission and brake temperature, engine RPM, tire pressure, fuel consumption and other values.

###### Which role does data analytics play?
Big data analytics, applied in the industry to leverage data collection, processing and analysis, can allow a better understanding of production system's abnormal behavior. This knowledge is essential for the adoption of a proactive maintenance approach instead of conventional time-based strategies, leading to a paradigm shift towards Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) since decision is now based on the usage of a huge, diverse, and dynamic amounts of data as a means to optimize operational costs.

### Heartbeat Monitoring of Network Nodes

###### How does a heartbeat monitor in a network work?
Signal which is generated in intervals to make sure everything works correctly.
Usually a heartbeat is sent between machines at a regular interval in the order of seconds. If the endpoint does not receive a heartbeat for a time—usually a few heartbeat intervals—the machine that should have sent the heartbeat is assumed to have failed.

###### What can it be used for?
* Detected failed parts of a network
* For instance, a heartbeat network uses timestamping to monitor the nodes on a high availability computer cluster
