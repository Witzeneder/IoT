### Project Examples

###### Powermanagement on ESP8266
* In Project 1 would make sense if it isn't connected to a power source (e.g. the sensors in the tomato field)

###### Bullet points for presentation
* judge if it is a true IoT Project
* highlight two ideas, relevant for potential project scenario
* sketch scenario ideas
* two realization questions about not presented projects
