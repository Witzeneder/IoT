###### [Remote health monitoring]

Walter lives alone in a flat located in a major city. The next doctor or hospital are to far away for his needs because after an knee injury a few years ago Walter isn't able to walk to the doctor or to the hospital by himself. His only relatives live to far away to take him there every time he doesn't feel good.

Because of that Walter's doctor proposed the solution of remote health monitoring with the help of IoT.
With the help of a new smart watch Walter can monitor his health parameters.

The smart watch sends ECG's in fixed timeframes to Walter's doctor, who is able to determine if everything is ok or if Walter is in need of medical attention.

In the morning the watch reminds Walter to take all of his medication and to drink enough during the day because the its a very hot day during summer.

After eating his lunch the smart watch again reminds Walter to take his medication and to do some exercises for his knee injury.

At 18:00 the smart watch is displaying to Walter, that he should take a little walk because he hasn't reached is step goal yet for the day.

During the night the smart watch is monitoring the sleep behaviour of Walter to detect irregularities.

In case of an emergency the smart watch automatically calls an ambulance and unlocks the smart lock on Walters front door

The next day the doctor checks the data which was transmitted by the smart watch and can determine whether Walter has to come by his office or if everything is going well.
