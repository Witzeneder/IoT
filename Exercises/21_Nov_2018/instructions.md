### Homework watch the video:
##### What is fog computing?
not only communication between device and cloud, also between device and device

##### What is the edge (regarding to IoT)?
the edge is the bridge or entry point to the internet
##### What are the different categories of the presented open source frameworks?
Open Kura - Gateway + integration
Node Red - Integration on an IoT Gateway
Flogo - Integration on an IoT Gateway and edge applications
##### Which framework did you like best and why?
I liked most Node-Red, because we it has a good documentation, in not as young as Flogo and has a UI to do your stuff. Also nice is the fact that you code in JS.
