Jakob and Hans live together with their three cats in a small house located in a remote part of greenland.
The house has a big living room, kitchen, basement, garage, two bedrooms and a boxroom to store groceries and hunting prey. Jakob is working on the snowmobile in the garage because it's broken and needs to be fixed until the next day. Hans is in the kitchen preparing the dinner. The cats sleep in their home made cats castle, which Jakob made for them to have their own place.

The motion sensor in the garage sensors the movement of Jakob working on the snowmobile, so the systems orders to light to be on and the radio to play Jakobs favourite playlist on spotify.

The temperatur sensor in the living room measures 19° Celsius and turns on the heating system to heat up in order to bring the temperatur back to the set temperatur of 23° Celsius during 05:30 and 23:00.

The cats get out of their castle, and position themself in front of their eating stale which is detected by the motion sensors. Thus the feeding system starts to fill their plates with cat food.

Jakob finished fixing the snowmobile and Hans is calling for dinner so he leaves the garage. This is recognised by the motion sensors, which leads to the lights and radio to turn off.

After dinner Hans and Jakob are watching TV until 23:00. This is their set time to go to sleep so 30 minutes before that, the heat system heats up their bedrooms and the TV turns off.

Before going to sleep Jakob checks via his tablet if all windows and doors are locked and that the cats ate and sleep in their castle.
