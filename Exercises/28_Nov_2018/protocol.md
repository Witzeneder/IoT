# Lab 7
We finished Project 1 with UlnoIoT.
[Project 1 Link](https://github.com/Witzeneder/IoT/blob/master/Projects/1/instructions.md)

### Problems:
* We needed to upgrade the UlnoIoT several times for all to work
* We deployed in the home archive of the OS, so the OS hung up and we had to install UlnoIoT fresh again and make all the setup
* The display showed in the beginning some random characters - in the end we fixed it, i dont know how.
